 <p style="color:grey;font-size:20px;position:relative;"><font color="black;size="20px">Carpooling</font> is known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage when two or more people make 
 
 the same commute ride in the same car or company vehicle to cut back on costs, traffic and air pollution, it is known as carpooling.
 Traffic is a major hindrance to commuters in large or poorly planned cities. 
 Each individual may own their own car and so largely populated areas frequently suffer from air pollution or smog. Carpooling is an easy, 
 inexpensive way for daily commuters to fight air pollution
 and also it reduces the number of vehicles on the road and the consumption of gasoline.
 Carpooling is common means of transport for many passengers, especially those who work in the same office or nearby offices.
 It is a good idea to think if you do not have your own vehicle and also if you do not want to experience the difficulty
 associated to traveling in public transport. A varying degree of formality and regularity is involved in carpooling 
 arrangements and schemes. A variety of sources are responsible for motivation of carpooling. An individual who is environmentally 
 conscious or others who want to enjoy the social or financial benefits may prefer carpooling.
